# Download this word list
# Save it in your development directory.
# Create a function called get_words_from_file. This function should read the fileâ€™s content and return the words as a collection. What is the correct data type to store the words?
# Create another function called get_random_sentence which takes a single parameter called length. The length parameter will be used to determine how many words the sentence should have. The function should:
# use the words list to get your random words.
# the amount of words should be the value of the length parameter.
# Take the random words and create a sentence (using a python method), the sentence should be lower case.
# Create a function called main which will:
# Print a message explaining what the program does.
# Ask the user how long they want the sentence to be. Acceptable values are: an integer between 2 and 20. Validate your data and test your validation!
# If the user inputs incorrect data, print an error message and end the program.
# If the user inputs correct data, run your code.
